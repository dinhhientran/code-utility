    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is an online converter tool which helps to convert JSON to YAML and vice versa.</p>
    <h3>How to use this tool?</h3>
    <p>You can input/paste your code directly into the editor, then click the Convert button. After converting, you can download or save/share the result. It will create a link for you to share with others. You can also sign-in using Google/GitHub to save results into your account.</p>
    <h3>What is JSON?</h3>

    <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation, pronounced /ˈdʒeɪsən/; also /ˈdʒeɪˌsɒn/) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, such as serving as a replacement for XML in AJAX systems.</p>

    <h3>What is YAML?</h3>

    <p>YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.</p>
    <p>YAML targets many of the same communications applications as Extensible Markup Language (XML) but has a minimal syntax which intentionally differs from SGML.[1] It uses both Python-style indentation to indicate nesting, and a more compact format that uses [...] for lists and {...} for maps[1] so that JSON files are valid YAML 1.2</p>
