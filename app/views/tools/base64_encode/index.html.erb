    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is an online base64 encoder tool which helps to convert to string to base64 data.</p>
    <h3>How to use this tool?</h3>
    <p>You can input/paste your string directly into the editor, then click the encode/decode button to encode/decode your string.</p>
    <p>After encoding/decoding, you can download, save or share the result. It will create a short link for you to share with others. You can also sign-in using Google/GitHub to save result into your account.</p>
    <h3>What is Base64?</h3>

    <p>Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. The term Base64 originates from a specific MIME content transfer encoding.</p>

    <p>Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII. This is to ensure that the data remain intact without modification during transport. Base64 is commonly used in a number of applications including email via MIME, and storing complex data in XML.</p>
